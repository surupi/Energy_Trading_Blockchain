## Introduction

The Energy Trading Blockchain project aims to revolutionize the energy sector by leveraging blockchain technology to enable efficient and transparent energy trading. This platform allows producers and consumers of renewable energy to transact directly, reducing reliance on traditional centralized energy grids.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run and contribute to the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (Smart contract development and deployment framework)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (Personal blockchain for Ethereum development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/energy-trading-blockchain.git
    cd energy-trading-blockchain
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Deploy smart contracts:

    ```bash
    truffle migrate
    ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Start Ganache:

    ```bash
    ganache-cli
    ```

2. Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the user interface.

## Architecture

The Energy Trading Blockchain project follows a decentralized architecture utilizing Ethereum smart contracts for energy trading. The key components include:

- **Smart Contracts:** Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to manage energy transactions.
- **Web Interface:** A user-friendly interface for participants to interact with the platform.
- **Decentralized Identity:** Secure and private identity management for users.

The platform leverages a decentralized network to ensure transparency and security. Each energy transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and auditable ledger.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts folder contains the Ethereum smart contracts responsible for managing energy transactions. Before deploying, ensure the contracts are thoroughly reviewed and tested.
